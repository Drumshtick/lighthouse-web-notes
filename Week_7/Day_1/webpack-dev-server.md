# Webpack Dev Server
We need to be able to quickly and easily see the effect of our changes to the project. The [webpack-dev-server](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/dev-server/) provides a live environment that updates the the browser when a file is saved.

NOTE: The webpack-dev-server should only be used for development. A production bundle should be built when deploying the application to the public.
