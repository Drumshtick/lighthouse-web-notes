# Storybook [HERE](https://storybook.js.org/docs/basics/introduction/)
**Components will be built in isolation** using a tool called Storybook. It may seem like an extra step because we can do all of the same things with webpack-dev-server. The Storybook environment is designed to speed up the development and testing of individual components. The benefits will become more evident as an application scales.

Storybook will be installed into the project folder making it easy to import and test the project components. This is a live environment that allows us to quickly iterate on features. When we save a file the bundle will be rebuilt and the browser will reload to reflect the changes.
