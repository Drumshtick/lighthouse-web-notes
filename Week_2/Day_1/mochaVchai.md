# What Is Mocha vs What Is Chai

## Mocha gives us the ```describe``` and ```it``` functions. **Each ```it``` is a test**, and **each test should have at least one assertion.**

### Speaking of assertions ...

## ***Chai is an assertion library.*** It **gives us assertion functions** so that we no longer have to use our assertEqual and other assertion functions that we implemented previously. Chai assertion functions are deliberately designed to play nice with testing frameworks like Mocha.
