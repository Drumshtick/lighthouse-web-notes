# What the Heck is Object Orientation?
**Object Orientation,** commonly *abbreviated "OO",* is probably the ***biggest concept in software development philosophy of the last thirty years.*** Some of the most popular languages today like Ruby, Java, and C# have been designed mainly for Object Oriented Programming, or "OOP". But what is Object Orientation?

A huge part of the point of object orientation is to give us a plan for modularity. When we program in an object oriented way, *we use objects to keep our code modular and reduce repetition.*
## A Brief History of OO
Object-Oriented Programming is a way of writing code that *encourages modularity* and *reduces duplication through the use of objects.* It **originated in the 1960s** and *became popular with C++ in the 1990s.*

## Some OO Languages
Here's a list of some programming languages that are predominantly OO:
* C++
* C#
* Java
* Python
* Ruby
* PHP
* Swift
* Objective-C

Coincidentally, some of these make up the most popular languages in use today. You may even recognize most of these languages by name.

Here are some other *****languages that chose to use Functional Programming (FP),***** a different paradigm:

* Erlang
* Common Lisp
* Elixir
* Haskell
* Clojure

If we had more time, we'd love to go deeper into one of the FP languages above.

Given the apparent popularity and adoption of the OO languages, you can appreciate that you're much more likely to work with software and developers that use OO.

## So is JavaScript "OO"?
You may wonder why JavaScript is not mentioned in the list of OO languages above. **JavaScript has multiple paradigms;** it initially *popularized Functional Programming* but **was also object-oriented.** With *****ES6 however, JavaScript brought in more OOP features,***** further enhancing the language.

Having multiple paradigms arguably makes a language more flexible and powerful, but also tends to cause confusion among its community. That said, in using JavaScript to learn OOP we have the benefit of learning OO in an evolutionary way. This is a luxury that most other languages don't support.

In this section we will learn about the fundamentals of OOP and how to use it in JavaScript.

## Conclusion
* OO is a software development paradigm
* OO is a popular way to solve code organization, re-use and modularity
* OO is very important to learn due to its popularity
* JavaScript is not strictly OO in the way that Java or Ruby are
* Functional Programming is an alternative paradigm, and one that JavaScript also encourages
