# Higher-Order Functions
```Spoiler Alert: Functions that take in callbacks are referred to as Higher Order Functions.```

Actually, we can define them more accurately.

Higher-Order functions are any functions which operate on other functions.

This includes, but is not limited to, functions which take in functions (callbacks) as arguments.

This means that built-in functions such as forEach, filter, and others can be called "Higher-Order Functions".

Having functions available to us as values allows us to pass them around. In programming languages like JS which support this, we are able to create higher-order functions. ***This is a major part of Functional Programming. Functional Programming has various other aspects that we're not going to touch formally quite yet.***
