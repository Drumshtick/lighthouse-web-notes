# Primitive Data Types
## Let's review the six types of primitives:
1. undefined
2. null
3. boolean
4. string
5. number
6. symbol (Introduced in ES6 and not something we need to focus on right now)

## Objects Are Not Primitives
**Anything not in that list (for example, a Date) is an Object.** Objects are not primitive data types.

We've already been introduced to objects, arrays, and of course functions, the latter two of which are technically a sub-category of objects. Objects ***(including arrays and functions and other types of objects)*** have properties.

## ****The six primitive types, plus object, make up the seven fundamental types of JavaScript.****
