## Linear Search
* Searching one item at a time until a match is found

## Binary Search
Binary search is an efficient algorithm for finding an item from a sorted list of items. **It works by repeatedly dividing in half the portion of the list that could contain the item, until you've narrowed down the possible locations to just one.** We used binary search in the [guessing game](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-science/algorithms/intro-to-algorithms/a/a-guessing-game) in the introductory tutorial.
* Every time we double the size of the array, we need at most one more guess.
